2. Life Planning and Problem Solving [Responsibility Monitoring Productivity webapp](https://github.com/CodeSolutions2/responsibility_monitoring)
3. Motivation [Memetics motivation image generation](https://github.com/CodeSolutions2/memetics_motivation_image)
   - A field of study called memetics arose in the 1990s to explore the concepts and transmission of memes in terms of an evolutionary model. An Internet meme, or meme is a cultural item (such as an idea, behavior, or style) that spreads across the Internet, primarily through social media platforms. Typically, images, videos, GIFs, and other "viral media" content are used to encourage mimicking/miming of a concept.  The inspriation of this webapp is to encourage mimicking of motivation and leading a happy-productive life, by generating motivational images using AI models.
   - There is a manual version where the user can create their own motivational images, and an automatic version where users can simply receive a motivational AI generated image on important topics including [health, education, life-balance, happiness, success, effective communication]
