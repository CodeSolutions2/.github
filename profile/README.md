## README

CodeSolutions2 is the GitHub organization name for selling code-related projects independently and on Upwork.

Projects include:

1. [Data Science Observations in a Chaotic World: How to be more responsible and why it is important](https://j622amilah.github.io/userservicesite/Observations_of_a_Data_Scientist.html) - *8,50â‚¬ per webapp accesskey (in progress)*
2. [Automatic csv file ingestion code in bash: sorting of files by header, upload to cloud](https://github.com/CodeSolutions2/automatic_csv_file_ingestion) - *$100*
3. [Client-Server spreadsheet Google Apps Script code](https://github.com/CodeSolutions2/client_server_spreadsheet_webapp) - *$30*
4. 



[3] Python Question Quiz Application chatgpt integration code [Starter: $30, Standard: $100, Advanced: $400]

The objective of this work was to create a Computer or web application that can present questions and answers to test-takers, grade test-taker performance, and allow for test-takers to view chatbot performance with respect to their performance. Adult professionals, in addition to young people, need to study for and pass career-related exams. A simplistic flash card-like application is useful for many people to practice their study content. There are several question quiz application programs that exist for the computer, cloud, and phone. However, many of the existing applications do not grade the user or record what questions were answered incorrectly for later study. In addition, none of the question quiz applications allow for usage with a chatbot to understand one's study competence with respect to an intelligent robot. There are three tiers of this workflow: PySimpleGUI Python code, JavaScript HTML webapp code, JavaScript HTML webapp w/BigQuery integration code. These code workflows/solutions will be delivered with instructions on how to use the code.

[4] Tensorflow.js Image Labeling code [Starter: $30, Standard: $400, Advanced: $800]

The objective of this work was to create a web application that can automatically label images that are in a GitHub repository. The user inputs the Github repository url and the web application outputs a table/csv file of each repo image with a label. This application is useful for creating supervised image prediction models, because it is necessary to have a reliable label for each image that a supervised model will be trained on. 

There are three tiers of this workflow: Webapp code-Tensorflow models, Webapp code-Custom model, Webapp code-Custom BigData. 
Tier 1: read images from a GitHub repo, use a pre-trained Tensorflow.js model (mobilenet or ssdcoco) to detect objects in each image, create a table of the image name and predicted label.  
Tier 2: perform tier 1 functionality and train a Custom trained Tensorflow model specifically for the data.
Tier 3:  perform tier 2 functionality and  efficient memory usage strategies, such as batching reading and writing data to Cloud Storage, to accommodate large quantities of data (Big Data).

These code workflows/solutions will be delivered with instructions on how to use the code.
